## Installation

You can install `sentinel-to-zarr` via [pip]:

    pip install sentinel-to-zarr

## Usage
This package provides command-line utilities for:
- Processing raw Sentinel zips of a tile into multiscale zarr
- Processing interpolated “GapFilled” tif for that tile into zarr, rechunking along time axis
- Processing the zarr from step 2 into multiscale OME-zarr


### Raw Zipped Images to Zarr
Install the latest version of napari using

`pip install -U napari`

Install napari-sentinel-to-zarr using 

`pip install napari-sentinel-to-zarr`

Run `sentinel-to-zarr zip-to-zarr path/to/tile/55HBU out/path/dir/55HBU.zarr`

where `path/to/tile/55HBU` is a directory full of Sentinel zips

### Interpolated Images to Zarr
Run `sentinel-to-zarr interpolated-to-zarr path/to/interpolated/55HBU_GapFilled_Image.tif out/dir/Image.zarr`

You can pass in optional arguments:
- `--step-size` - how many slices to convert at once. The default is 20 which will require ~5GB RAM. A larger step size means more slices can be loaded at once, and will speed up performance. A full image is typically ~175GB.
- `--chunk-size` - the chunk size of the resulting zarr. Default is 1024 which is typically considered a good option and provides good performance


### Interpolated Zarr to Multiscale Zarr
Run `sentinel-to-zarr zarr-to-multiscale-zarr path/to/interpolated/zarr out/path/interpolated_multiscale.zarr tilename`

Where `path/to/interpolated/zarr` is the output file from step 2

You can pass in optional arguments
- `--min-shape-` the smallest pyramid level you wish to generate. Default is 1024px

## Napari Plugin
This package also comes with a napari writer plugin which allows you to open the raw tiles directly by dragging one into a napari viewer, and saving out while you browse using `File>Save Layers`
